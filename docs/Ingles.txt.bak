Im my last job worked at Berry Global, an American company, as Electronics Technician 
for over four years. 
Berry produces non-woven and has dozens production lines in several branches throughout 
Latin America.
At Berry, I learned and specialized in industrial automation, maintaining production lines, 
performing interventions in PLCs, industrial computers, inverters, sensors, etc. 
Also I developed applications (mainly in Java language) for desktop and mobile.

Before that I worked for six years at Sicpa, a Switzerland Company.
My tasks were in the mainteance of the SICOBE Project, a system that controls and tracks 
the production of beverages (beer, water, soda, etc) throughtout Brazil, counting, 
identifiyng and printing a datamatrix code on the product (on the lid or under the can).
I had the opportunity to learn many things, and got through lot of experiences.
(Programming PLCs, repairing prints (deskjets),configuring sensors and TCP/IP networks).

First of all I worked with energy systems (no-breaks, stabilizers, battery charges, etc) 
for almost twenty years, and during this period I had my own bussiness for six years.
(Mainly Motor-home automation).

WHY DID YOU LEAVE OR GET FIRED?
In Berry, the sector I worked in was outsourced to an external company.
(I wasn't happy, but I understood their side, its a part of bussiness.)
In Sicpa, the project was closed.
(I heard that there was a case of corruption in the company).

PERSPECTIVES - GOALS
I've already achieved many of my goals, but in my area we cannot stand still, because
there are always new technologies.
I hope to learn new things, improve my english, bring good results to the team, 
being working in 'ISRA company' for a while, being in a good position and help 
my leadership to get a better position. (We will grow together).

HIRE ME
I have experience and skills to make the work, and I know a little about the product, 
and I believe that my profile fits what they are looking for.

WHY WANT THIS JOB - LOOKING FOR
(Because I need! rs...)
But I believe its a great opportunity for grouth in my carrer.
In this company I will be able to work on what I like, I will have the possibility of 
learning new things and growing with the team.
I have heard good things about ISRA company.
Multinational companies tend to have a more serious management and give more stability 
to employees. So I believe that this job add to my values.

PRODUCT
I already know a little about your product.
When Tavares carried out interventions at Berry Global, I helped him on the tasks,
Mainly on computer or networks problems.
I instaled No-breaks in the cabinets of the ISRA systems in all line produtions at Berry.
I was responsible for making backup images for the ISRA systems.
I also replaced all Hard Disks with Solid State Disks.
Aignment of cameras, replacement of peripherals too.

FORCES - STRENGTHS
I dedicate myself to tasks;
I'm obstinate to improve process;
I love to learn new things;
I always try to fulfill my tasks on time;
I like to share my knowledge and help others;

TEAM PLAYER
Yes. I like to cooperate with others and always try to share my knowledge.
For me, its very important in the workplace.

HOBBIES - FREE TIME
I like to be spend time with my family, watching movies and football, 
work in my garden and barbecue with friends.
Used to be a coach in amateur football and I was also a teacher at a children's 
football school.

WEAKNESS
I'm little eager, anxious;
(I used to be, today I'm better.)
I don't accept delays;
I dont like in to speak in public.
Sometimes I prefer to work things out myself;
(But I have been working on those weaknesses... 8-)

REACT TO CRITICISM
I always try to deal constructively. After receive, I would spend a time observing my 
attitudes to assess the situation, and communicate my superior and I ask you for help.

WORKING UNDER PRESSURE - DIFFICULT SITUATIONS - OVERCAME A CHALLENGE
In my last job I had to deals with a insatisfied production employees, as they were my 
internal costumers.
I always tried to remember that was nothing personal and I need to focus on the 
technical issues to solve the problem, because that was also mine too.
Always dealing professionally, seeking information and solutions, because sometimes, 
the task demands greater skills than I possessed.
I think had ability to learn the necessary and manage the work.

RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS
I usually have a good relatioship, I can't remember any problems.
I don't leave any job because bad relations.

WAGE REQUEST - SORT A SALARIAL
In my previous job I was earning a little over seven thousands REAIS.
But I'm willing to negotiate salary and benefits, its flexible.
It is difficult to talk only about salary because it depends on the benefits offered.
I had like to hear about the benefits first, if possible.
I have already been informed about this.
I believe I fit into the salary sort and the career plan attracted me.

BRAZILIAN SITUATION
Im my opinion, the Brazilian government has to take control of the situation and
work harded to solve our problems. In this moment of difficulty, the Brazilian 
people need to learn how to save the money to get the through this situation.
I think that financial education should be a subject in Brazilian schools, 
so since we would learn how to deal with money.
In fact, Brazil needs a lot of investment in education.

WORLD CUP
I hope Brazil becomes the champions.
But we depend a lot on Neymar, he needs to play for the team. I think he's very selfish.
But I like Germany too, because it's the country of my grandparents.
(Yes, my mother's and father's parents migrated from Germany during the First War.)

TO PROGRAMMING
This position in this company is different from the position that 
I used to have at my previous jobs.
So it means that I want to change my professional area, 
and this opportunity is what I'm looking for.
